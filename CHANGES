Version history in details:
---------------------------

Version 1.0 was the initial release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1 fixes a bug in the detection of potential infinite recursions
(this bug did not cause any malfunction, but increased the time needed for
this check unnecessarily!).

The code was cleaned from left-overs from previous versions, i.e., the
statements "carp - exit" were replaced by "croak", as this is what they
should be.

Finally, the description was changed to make it more accurate and easy
to understand, and the documentation was brushed up at a few places.
